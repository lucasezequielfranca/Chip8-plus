# CHIP-8 Interpreter

A simple CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++ and SDL2 for graphics. Made to study emulation, low-level concepts, and how a CPU cycle works. The interpreter was tested with Timendius chip8 test suit, wich is included in roms folder.

The interpreter runs with default CHIP-8 resolutin but have the super-chip quirks enabled as it is required for most games.

* **Instruction Cycle (Fetch-Decode-Execute):** Basic cycle implemented, running instructions straight from memory.
* **Clock Sync:** The Cycle runs freely inside a batch of instructions per frame (~700 Hz), while the Timers and the screen renderer run locked at 60 Hz using `std::chrono`.
* **Log debugger:** Fully functinal log debbugger, with a option to toggle step by step (input wont work in this mode).
* **Settings**: Configurable colors and keyboard key inside display.cpp and instructions pre frame inside chip8.cpp.
* **Keypad**: Default keypad works wuing the following map:
  original chip-8 keypad           mine interpreter keypad \n
         1 2 3 C                        1 2 3 4\n
         4 5 6 D           ----->       q w e r\n
         7 8 9 E                        a s d f\n
         A 0 B F                        z x c v\n

## 🕹️ Test Status

* **Pong:** Fully functional and playable. 
* **Timendius Test Suit:** Passing all checks on the modern behavior screen (with Shift, Memory, and Jump flags enabled).

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run
### Compiling
Without using make file you will need to use the follow command at root folder:
```
(clang++ or gdd++) scr/*.cpp -o chip8 -std=c++17 -lSDL2
```

### Dependencies
You need a working compiler with C++17 support and the **SDL2** library installed on your system.
I've only tested in arch linux, so windows support may not be working
