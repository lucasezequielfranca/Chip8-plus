# CHIP-8 Interpreter

A simple CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++ and SDL2 for graphics. Made to study emulation, low-level concepts, and how a CPU cycle works. The interpreter was tested with Timendius chip8 test suit, wich is included in roms folder.

The interpreter runs with default CHIP-8 resolutin but have the super-chip quirks enabled as it is required for most games.

* **Instruction Cycle (Fetch-Decode-Execute):** Basic cycle implemented, running instructions straight from memory.
* **Clock Sync:** The Cycle runs freely inside a batch of instructions per frame (~700 Hz), while the Timers and the screen renderer run locked at 60 Hz using `std::chrono`.
* **Log debugger:** Fully functinal log debbugger, with a option to toggle step by step (input wont work in this mode).
* **Settings**: Configurable colors and keyboard key inside display.cpp and instructions pre frame inside chip8.cpp.
```markdown
* **Keypad**: Default keypad works using the following map:

| Original Chip-8 Keypad | | Mine Interpreter Keypad |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `1` `2` `3` `C` | | `1` `2` `3` `4` |
| `4` `5` `6` `D` | **---->** | `q` `w` `e` `r` |
| `7` `8` `9` `E` | | `a` `s` `d` `f` |
| `A` `0` `B` `F` | | `z` `x` `c` `v` |

## 🕹️ Test Status

* **Pong:** Fully functional and playable. 
* **Timendius Test Suit:** Passing all checks on the modern behavior screen (with Shift, Memory, and Jump flags enabled).

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run
### Compiling
Without using make file you will need to use the follow command at root folder:
```
(clang++ or gdd++) scr/*.cpp -o chip8 -std=c++17 -lSDL2
```

### Dependencies
You need a working compiler with C++17 support and the **SDL2** library installed on your system.
I've only tested in arch linux, so windows support may not be working
